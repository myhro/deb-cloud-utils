Description: cloud image management utilities
 This package provides a useful set of utilities for managing cloud
 images.
 .
 The euca2ools package (a dependency of cloud-utils) provides an
 Amazon EC2 API compatible set of utilities for bundling kernels,
 ramdisks, and root filesystems, and uploading them to either EC2
 or UEC.
 .
 The tasks associated with image bundling are often tedious and
 repetitive.  The cloud-utils package provides several scripts
 that wrap the complicated tasks with a much simpler interface.
