 - cloud-publish-image: add '--hook-img' flag to cloud-publish-image and
   passthrough that flag from cloud-publish-ubuntu and cloud-publish-tarball.
 - ubuntu-cloudimg-query: become aware of m3.* instance-sizes
 - fix make-dist-tarball to not have top level directory 
   named 'cloud-init' (thanks Juerg Haefliger)
 - write-mime-multipart: add 'include-once-url' to the supported types.
 - growpart: add support for resizing GPT partitions by using sgdisk from
   gptfdisk project.  Thanks to Juerg Haefliger.
 - growpart: add support for partx 'update' which allows resizing a partition
   that is mounted.
 - growpart: change exit codes. exit 1 on "no change necessary",
   0 on "grown", 2 on "failure". This allows other tools that use growpart to
  examine the exit status rather than parsing the output.
