.SH NAME
\fBcloud-run-instances\fP - wrapper for euca-run-instances that supports an option for injecting public ssh keys retrievable from \fILaunchpad.net\fP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "cloud-run-instances [-l|--launchpad-id lp_id_1,lp_id_2,lp_id_3] [euca-run-instances options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is a wrapper script for \fBeuca-run-instances\fP(1) that takes one additional option, \fB-l|--launchpad-id\fP.

With this option, a user can specify a comma-separated list of \fILaunchpad.net\fP usernames.

Once the instance is booted, the cloud-init boot script will retrieve the public ssh keys of the specified users from Launchpad.net using \fBssh-import-lp-id\fP(1).

All other options besides \fB-l|--launchpad-id\fP are simply passed on to \fBeuca-run-instances\fP(1).

.SH SEE ALSO
